# node-red-contrib-node-reddit
## Overview
Interact with Reddit using [Node-RED](https://nodered.org).

## Nodes

For more detailed information about functionality, inputs, and outputs, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/jcostello93/node-red-contrib-node-reddit/wiki) or the node's documentation window within the Node-RED editor. 

* **Config:** authentication for the Reddit API
* **Stream:** stream submissions and comments from a subreddit or PMs from your inbox
* **Get:** get submissions, comments, or personal messages from a subreddit, user, your inbox, or the content's id, according to its configuration
* **Create:** create a new Reddit submission or PM
* **Reply:** reply to a submission, comment, or PM
* **Search:** perform a Reddit search query in a subreddit
* **Edit:** edit a Reddit submission or comment.
* **Delete:** delete a Reddit submission, comment, or PM.
* **React:** save/unsave and/or vote/unvote on Reddit content. 

### New: Moderator actions
These actions require that your account has moderator access to the specified subreddit.

* **Get Modqueue:** get reported items for a given subreddit

## Populating fields

For all nodes other than config and stream, all text fields may be hardcoded via text or dynamically populated via mustache syntax relative to the incoming msg object.

For example, let's say you're getting hot submissions from a subreddit using the get node. If the target <code>subreddit</code> is located in <code>msg.payload.target</code>, then you can fill in <code>{{payload.target}}</code> in the <code>subreddit</code> field.
